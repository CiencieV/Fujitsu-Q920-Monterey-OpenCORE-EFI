# Fujitsu-Q920-Monterey-OpenCORE-EFI
It's just OpenCore EFI for Fujitsu Q920
My Q920 specs are i5 4590T, 8GB ram (512mb for iGPU), 128GB mSATA SSD, 128GB SATA SSD, 500GB HDD (in place of DVD). Everything should work except for audio but it's easy fix for Realtek ALC671, also I don't have wifi card so I couldn't test that.
